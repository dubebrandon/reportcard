                  <b>People and culture first</b>
                  <p/>
                  The first step in moving to DevSecOps is to pull from agile principles - people first, then process and tools.
                  <br/>  <br/>
                  Culture is the foundation on which every successful team is built and is a core ingredient of a DevSecOps implementation. A DevSecOps culture brings a sense of shared responsibility across teams, yields faster time to market and faster resolution times, and helps mitigate unplanned work.
                  <br/>  <br/>
                  One small but impactful way to initiate culture change is to run workshops that identify areas of improvement between your dev & ops teams. 
                  <br/>  <br/>
                   These foundational steps will help you look at the three ways of DevSecOps - flow, amplify feedback, and continuous learning and experimentation - each phase flows into the other to break down silos and inform key stakeholders.
                   <p/>
                   To help, we've built a DevSecOps Wiki with a Team Health Assessment. Also we run monthly sessions in the DevOps CoP to help your teams learn the latest and greatest tools, techniques and strategies for achieving higher performance.

                  <br/><br/>
                 
                  To master 'flow' teams need to make work visible across all teams, limit work in progress, and reduce hand-offs to start thinking as a system, not a silo. One way to start approaching 'flow' is through practices like agile. 
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  Another way to master 'flow' is by moving to distributed version control systems (DVCS) like Git, which is all about quick iterations, branching and merging - all things you need in a lean DevSecOps environment.

                  <b>Amplify feedback loops for faster resolution</b>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  Amplifying feedback can help you catch failures before they make it downstream, and accelerate your time to resolution. One easy way to speed up feedback is by automating notifications so that teams are alerted to incidents or bugs when they happen.

                  <br/>
                  We see DevSecOps as a life-cycle with each phase flowing into the other to break down silos and inform key stakeholders along the way. You plan the work, then build it, continuously integrate it, deploy it, finally support the end product and provide feedback back into the system.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  The tools and technology your teams use can drive better automation and collaboration between teams. 
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  At this stage you should be sharing your journey and lessons at the monthly DevOps CoP. Also collaborating with other teams to explore new practices or exploring new techniques in our Mastery section above to find bleeding-edge practices in play across our organization.

                <h4>How did we come up with this?</h4>

                <p/>
                If you're already planning your DevSecOps journey, surely you've been inspired by success stories like Flickr, Netflix, and Etsy. In the best cases, those stories describe where they started, how long it took them, and how things changed. However, following those examples is hard because the journey is so unfamiliar. A common problem is the journey is described as one big leap, where all the invest is characterized as "culture change" and all the DevSecOps benefits are lumped together. Fortunately, we can use an adaptation of the agile fluency model to help break apart some discrete steps.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The reality is: there are some distinct stages, each with different benefits and different kinds of investment.
                <p/>
                Mapping agile fluency to DevSecOps, we propose four stages:

                  <ul><li>Orient to value for your organization</li>
                  <li>Automate, as a team</li>
                  <li>Measure business value</li>
                  <li>Optimize for the whole </li>
                </ul>
                <br/>

          <b>Does the customer know the team members and interact with them each week?</b></p>
          <p>
          Your Answer: N</p>
         
          

          <h4> Why is this important?</h4>
          <b>Often time customer interaction is a key predictor of success. In agile environments we value "customer collaboration over contract negotiation". </b> Using an agile approach in practice, you experience a partnership between the customer and development team in which discovery, questioning, learning, and adjusting during the course of the project are routine, acceptable, and systematic.
          <br/><br/>
          On an agile project, customer review is built into the process and the customer gets to see the product at the end of every sprint. You can create the highest-priority features first, which gives you the opportunity to ensure maximum value early on, when little of the customers resources has been invested.

          <h4>Glossary of practices </h4>
              <b>Ensure the entire team understands the software life-cycle. </b> Your team needs to understand the overall life-cycle of the application, and which part of the life-cycle the application is currently in. This helps all team members know what they should be doing now, and what they should be planning and preparing for in the future.
              <p/>
              <b>Reduce cycle time. </b>Aim to minimize the time it takes to move from ideas to usable developed software. Limit the size and scope of individual releases to keep the test burden low. Automate the build, test, configuration, and deployment processes whenever possible. Clear any obstacles to communication among developers, and between developers and operations.
              <p/>
              <b>Review and improve processes. </b>Your processes and procedures, both automated and manual, are never final. Set up regular reviews of current workflows, procedures, and documentation, with a goal of continual improvement.
              <p/>
              <b>Do proactive planning. </b>Proactively plan for failure. Have processes in place to quickly identify issues when they occur, escalate to the correct team members to fix, and confirm resolution.
              <p/>
              <b>Learn from failures. </b>Failures are inevitable, but it's important to learn from failures to avoid repeating them. If an operational failure occurs, triage the issue, document the cause and solution, and share any lessons that were learned. Whenever possible, update your build processes to automatically detect that kind of failure in the future.
              <p/>
              <b>Optimize for speed and collect data. </b>Every planned improvement is a hypothesis. Work in the smallest increments possible. Treat new ideas as experiments. Instrument the experiments so that you can collect production data to assess their effectiveness. Be prepared to fail fast if the hypothesis is wrong.
              <p/>
              <b>Allow time for learning.</b> Both failures and successes provide good opportunities for learning. Before moving on to new projects, allow enough time to gather the important lessons, and make sure those lessons are absorbed by your team. Also give the team the time to build skills, experiment, and learn about new tools and techniques.
              <p/>
              <b> Document operations.</b> Document all tools, processes, and automated tasks with the same level of quality as your product code. Document the current design and architecture of any systems you support, along with recovery processes and other maintenance procedures. Focus on the steps you actually perform, not theoretically optimal processes. Regularly review and update the documentation. For code, make sure that meaningful comments are included, especially in public APIs, and use tools to automatically generate code documentation whenever possible.
              <p/>
              <b> Share knowledge.</b> Documentation is only useful if people know that it exists and can find it. Ensure the documentation is organized and easily discoverable. Be creative: Use brown bags (informal presentations), videos, or newsletters to share knowledge.

        <h4>Glossary of Practices</h4>      
        <b>Provide developers with production-like environments. </b>If development and test environments don't match the production environment, it is hard to test and diagnose problems. Therefore, keep development and test environments as close to the production environment as possible. Make sure that test data is consistent with the data used in production, even if it's sample data and not real production data (for privacy or compliance reasons). Plan to generate and anonymize sample test data.
        <p/>
        <b>Ensure that all authorized team members can provision infrastructure and deploy the application.</b> Setting up production-like resources and deploying the application should not involve complicated manual tasks or detailed technical knowledge of the system. Anyone with the right permissions should be able to create or deploy production-like resources without going to the operations team.

        <blockquote>
        This recommendation doesn't imply that anyone can push live updates to the production deployment. It's about reducing friction for the development and QA teams to create production-like environments.
        </blockquote>
        <p/>
        <b>Instrument the application for insight. </b>To understand the health of your application, you need to know how it's performing and whether it's experiencing any errors or problems. Always include instrumentation as a design requirement, and build the instrumentation into the application from the start. Instrumentation must include event logging for root cause analysis, but also telemetry and metrics to monitor the overall health and usage of the application.
        <p/>
        <b>Track your technical debt. </b>In many projects, release schedules can get prioritized over code quality to one degree or another. Always keep track when this occurs. Document any shortcuts or other nonoptimal implementations, and schedule time in the future to revisit these issues.
        <p/>
        <b>Consider pushing updates directly to production. </b> To reduce the overall release cycle time, consider pushing properly tested code commits directly to production. Use feature toggles to control which features are enabled. This allows you to move from development to release quickly, using the toggles to enable or disable features. Toggles are also useful when performing tests such as canary releases, where a particular feature is deployed to a subset of the production environment.

        <h4> Glossary of Practices</h4>
        <b>Automate testing. </b>Manually testing software is tedious and susceptible to error. Automate common testing tasks and integrate the tests into your build processes. Automated testing ensures consistent test coverage and reproducibility. Integrated UI tests should also be performed by an automated tool. OpenShift offers development and test resources that can help you configure and execute testing. For more information, see Development and test.


        <p/>
        <b>Test for failures.</b> If a system can't connect to a service, how does it respond? Can it recover once the service is available again? Make fault injection testing a standard part of review on test and staging environments. When your test process and practices are mature, consider running these tests in production.

        <p/>
        <b>Test in production.  </b>The release process doesn't end with deployment to production. Have tests in place to ensure that deployed code works as expected. For deployments that are infrequently updated, schedule production testing as a regular part of maintenance.
        <p/>

        <b>Automate performance testing to identify performance issues early. </b>The impact of a serious performance issue can be just as severe as a bug in the code. While automated functional tests can prevent application bugs, they might not detect performance problems. Define acceptable performance goals for metrics like latency, load times, and resource usage. Include automated performance tests in your release pipeline, to make sure the application meets those goals.
        <p/>
        <b>Perform capacity testing.</b> An application might work fine under test conditions, and then have problems in production due to scale or resource limitations. Always define the maximum expected capacity and usage limits. Test to make sure the application can handle those limits, but also test what happens when those limits are exceeded. Capacity testing should be performed at regular intervals.
        <p/>
        After the initial release, you should run performance and capacity tests whenever updates are made to production code. Use historical data to fine tune tests and to determine what types of tests need to be performed.
        <p/>
        <b>Perform automated security penetration testing. </b> Ensuring your application is secure is as important as testing any other functionality. Make automated penetration testing a standard part of the build and deployment process. Schedule regular security tests and vulnerability scanning on deployed applications, monitoring for open ports, endpoints, and attacks. Automated testing does not remove the need for in-depth security reviews at regular intervals.
        <p/>
        <b>Perform automated business continuity testing. </b> Develop tests for large scale business continuity, including backup recovery and failover. Set up automated processes to perform these tests regularly.

              Great job! You scored highly on the use of advanced practices. Review the glossary below and checkout the Mastery section for more cutting-edge practices.
           <h4>Glossary of practices </h4>
  
            <p><strong>Automate deployments.</strong>&nbsp;Automate deploying the application to test, staging, and production environments. Automation enables faster and more reliable deployments, and ensures consistent deployments to any supported environment. It removes the risk of human error caused by manual deployments. It also makes it easy to schedule releases for convenient times, to minimize any effects of potential downtime.</p>
              <p><strong>Use continuous integration.</strong>&nbsp;Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer code into a central codebase on a regular schedule, and then automatically performing standard build and test processes. CI ensures that an entire team can work on a codebase at the same time without having conflicts. It also ensures that code defects are found as early as possible. Preferably, the CI process should run every time that code is committed or checked in. At the very least, it should run once per day.</p>
             
              <p> <blockquote>Consider adopting a&nbsp;<a href="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/" data-linktype="external">trunk based development model</a>. In this model, developers commit to a single branch (the trunk). There is a requirement that commits never break the build. This model facilitates CI, because all feature work is done in the trunk, and any merge conflicts are resolved when the commit happens.</blockquote></p>
              
              <p><strong>Consider using continuous delivery.</strong>&nbsp;Continuous delivery (CD) is the practice of ensuring that code is always ready to deploy, by automatically building, testing, and deploying code to production-like environments. Adding continuous delivery to create a full CI/CD pipeline will help you detect code defects as soon as possible, and ensures that properly tested updates can be released in a very short time.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Continuous&nbsp;<em>deployment</em>&nbsp;is an additional process that automatically takes any updates that have passed through the CI/CD pipeline and deploys them into production. Continuous deployment requires robust automatic testing and advanced process planning, and may not be appropriate for all teams.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>Make small incremental changes.</strong>&nbsp;Large code changes have a greater potential to introduce bugs. Whenever possible, keep changes small. This limits the potential effects of each change, and makes it easier to understand and debug any issues.</p>
              <p><strong>Control exposure to changes.</strong>&nbsp;Make sure you're in control of when updates are visible to your end users. Consider using feature toggles to control when features are enabled for end users.</p>
              <p><strong>Implement release management strategies to reduce deployment risk.</strong>&nbsp;Deploying an application update to production always entails some risk. To minimize this risk, use strategies such as&nbsp;<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html" data-linktype="external">canary releases</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html" data-linktype="external">blue-green deployments</a>&nbsp;to deploy updates to a subset of users. Confirm the update works as expected, and then roll the update out to the rest of the system.</p>
              <p><strong>Document all changes.</strong>&nbsp;Minor updates and configuration changes can be a source of confusion and versioning conflict. Always keep a clear record of any changes, no matter how small. Log everything that changes, including patches applied, policy changes, and configuration changes. (Don't include sensitive data in these logs. For example, log that a credential was updated, and who made the change, but don't record the updated credentials.) The record of the changes should be visible to the entire team.</p>
              <p><strong>Automate Deployments.</strong>&nbsp;Automate all deployments, and have systems in place to detect any problems during roll-out. Have a mitigation process for preserving the existing code and data in production, before the update replaces them in all production instances. Have an automated way to roll forward fixes or roll back changes.</p>
              <p><strong>Consider making infrastructure immutable.</strong>&nbsp;Immutable infrastructure is the principle that you shouldn&rsquo;t modify infrastructure after it&rsquo;s deployed to production. Otherwise, you can get into a state where ad hoc changes have been applied, making it hard to know exactly what changed. Immutable infrastructure works by replacing entire servers as part of any new deployment. This allows the code and the hosting environment to be tested and deployed as a block. Once deployed, infrastructure components aren't modified until the next build and deploy cycle.
<p><strong>Document the release process for your application.</strong>&nbsp;Without detailed release process documentation, an operator might deploy a bad update or improperly configure settings for your application. Clearly define and document your release process, and ensure that it's available to the entire operations team.</p>
<p><strong>Automate your application's deployment process.</strong>&nbsp;If your operations staff is required to manually deploy your application, human error can cause the deployment to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Design your release process to maximize application availability.</strong>&nbsp;If your release process requires services to go offline during deployment, your application will be unavailable until they come back online. Use the&nbsp;<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html" data-linktype="external">blue/green</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html" data-linktype="external">canary release</a>&nbsp;deployment technique to deploy your application to production. Both of these techniques involve deploying your release code alongside production code so users of release code can be redirected to production code in the event of a failure.</p>
<p><strong>Log and audit your application's deployments.</strong>&nbsp;If you use staged deployment techniques such as blue/green or canary releases there will be more than one version of your application running in production. If a problem should occur, it's critical to determine which version of your application is causing a problem. Implement a robust logging strategy to capture as much version-specific information as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Have a rollback plan for deployment.</strong>&nbsp;It's possible that your application deployment could fail and cause your application to become unavailable. Design a rollback process to go back to a last known good version and minimize downtime.</p>

<p><strong>Automate operations tasks.</strong>&nbsp;Manually handling repetitive operations processes is error-prone. Automate these tasks whenever possible to ensure consistent execution and quality. Code that implements the automation should be versioned in source control. As with any other code, automation tools must be tested.</p>
<p><strong>Take an infrastructure-as-code approach to provisioning.</strong>&nbsp;Minimize the amount of manual configuration needed to provision resources. Instead, use scripts and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/OpenShift-resource-manager/" data-linktype="absolute-path">OpenShift Resource Manager</a>&nbsp;templates. Keep the scripts and templates in source control, like any other code you maintain.</p>
<p><strong>Consider using containers.</strong>&nbsp;Containers provide a standard package-based interface for deploying applications. Using containers, an application is deployed using self-contained packages that include any software, dependencies, and files needed to run the application, which greatly simplifies the deployment process.</p>
<p>Containers also create an abstraction layer between the application and the underlying operating system, which provides consistency across environments. This abstraction can also isolate a container from other processes or applications running on a host.</p>
<p><strong>Implement resiliency and self-healing.</strong>&nbsp;Resiliency is the ability of an application to recover from failures. Strategies for resiliency include retrying transient failures, and failing over to a secondary instance or even another region. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/architecture/resiliency/index" data-linktype="relative-path">Designing resilient applications for OpenShift</a>. Instrument your applications so that issues are reported immediately and you can manage outages or other system failures.</p>
<p><strong>Have an operations manual.</strong>&nbsp;An operations manual or&nbsp;<em>runbook</em>&nbsp;documents the procedures and management information needed for operations staff to maintain a system. Also document any operations scenarios and mitigation plans that might come into play during a failure or other disruption to your service. Create this documentation during the development process, and keep it up to date afterwards. This is a living document, and should be reviewed, tested, and improved regularly.</p>
<p>Shared documentation is critical. Encourage team members to contribute and share knowledge. The entire team should have access to documents. Make it easy for anyone on the team to help keep documents updated.</p>
<p><strong>Document on-call procedures.</strong>&nbsp;Make sure on-call duties, schedules, and procedures are documented and shared to all team members. Keep this information up-to-date at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Document escalation procedures for third-party dependencies.</strong>&nbsp;If your application depends on external third-party services that you don't directly control, you must have a plan to deal with outages. Create documentation for your planned mitigation processes. Include support contacts and escalation paths.</p>
<p><strong>Use configuration management.</strong>&nbsp;Configuration changes should be planned, visible to operations, and recorded. This could take the form of a configuration management database, or a configuration-as-code approach. Configuration should be audited regularly to ensure that what's expected is actually in place.</p>
<p><strong>Get an OpenShift support plan and understand the process.</strong>&nbsp;OpenShift offers a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://OpenShift.microsoft.com/support/plans/" data-linktype="external">support plans</a>. Determine the right plan for your needs, and make sure the entire team knows how to use it. Team members should understand the details of the plan, how the support process works, and how to open a support ticket with OpenShift. If you are anticipating a high-scale event, OpenShift support can assist you with increasing your service limits. For more information, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://OpenShift.microsoft.com/support/faq/" data-linktype="external">OpenShift Support FAQs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Follow least-privilege principles when granting access to resources.</strong>&nbsp;Carefully manage access to resources. Access should be denied by default, unless a user is explicitly given access to a resource. Only grant a user access to what they need to complete their tasks. Track user permissions and perform regular security audits.</p>
<p><strong>Use role-based access control.</strong>&nbsp;Assigning user accounts and access to resources should not be a manual process. Use&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/active-directory/role-based-access-control-what-is" data-linktype="absolute-path">Role-Based Access Control</a>&nbsp;(RBAC) grant access based on&nbsp;<a href="https://OpenShift.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/" data-linktype="external">OpenShift Active Directory</a>&nbsp;identities and groups.</p>
<p><strong>Use a bug tracking system to track issues.</strong>&nbsp;Without a good way to track issues, it's easy to miss items, duplicate work, or introduce additional problems. Don't rely on informal person-to-person communication to track the status of bugs. Use a bug tracking tool to record details about problems, assign resources to address them, and provide an audit trail of progress and status.</p>
<p><strong>Manage all resources in a change management system.</strong>&nbsp;All aspects of your DevSecOps process should be included in a management and versioning system, so that changes can be easily tracked and audited. This includes code, infrastructure, configuration, documentation, and scripts. Treat all these types of resources as code throughout the test/build/review process.</p>
<p><strong>Use checklists.</strong>&nbsp;Create operations checklists to ensure processes are followed. It&rsquo;s common to miss something in a large manual, and following a checklist can force attention to details that might otherwise be overlooked. Maintain the checklists, and continually look for ways to automate tasks and streamline processes.</p>

              <h4>Recovery Advice</h4><p/>
                  <em/>Great job! You scored highly on the use of advanced practices. Review the glossary below and checkout the Mastery section for more cutting-edge practices. </em>
                    <h4>Glossary of practices </h4>

            <p><strong>Make systems observable.</strong>&nbsp;The operations team should always have clear visibility into the health and status of a system or service. Set up external health endpoints to monitor status, and ensure that applications are coded to instrument the operations metrics. Use a common and consistent schema that lets you correlate events across systems.&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/monitoring-and-diagnostics/OpenShift-diagnostics" data-linktype="absolute-path">OpenShift Diagnostics</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/application-insights/" data-linktype="absolute-path">Application Insights</a>&nbsp;are the standard method of tracking the health and status of OpenShift resources. Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/operations-management-suite" data-linktype="external">Operation Management Suite</a>&nbsp;also provides centralized monitoring and management for cloud or hybrid solutions.</p>
          <p><strong>Aggregate and correlate logs and metrics</strong>. A properly instrumented telemetry system will provide a large amount of raw performance data and event logs. Make sure that telemetry and log data is processed and correlated in a short period of time, so that operations staff always have an up-to-date picture of system health. Organize and display data in ways that give a cohesive view of any issues, so that whenever possible it's clear when events are related to one another.</p>
          <blockquote>
         Consult your corporate retention policy for requirements on how data is processed and how long it should be stored.
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>Implement automated alerts and notifications.</strong>&nbsp;Set up monitoring tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview" data-linktype="absolute-path">OpenShift Monitor</a> to detect patterns or conditions that indicate potential or current issues, and send alerts to the team members who can address the issues. Tune the alerts to avoid false positives.</p>
          <p><strong>Monitor assets and resources for expirations.</strong>&nbsp;Some resources and assets, such as certificates, expire after a given amount of time. Make sure to track which assets expire, when they expire, and what services or features depend on them. Use automated processes to monitor these assets. Notify the operations team before an asset expires, and escalate if expiration threatens to disrupt the application.
</p>
<p><strong>Perform failover and failback testing for your application.</strong>&nbsp;If you haven't fully tested failover and failback, you can't be certain that the dependent services in your application come back up in a synchronized manner during disaster recovery. Ensure that your application's dependent services failover and fail back in the correct order.</p>
<p><strong>Perform fault-injection testing for your application.</strong>&nbsp;Your application can fail for many different reasons, such as certificate expiration, exhaustion of system resources in a VM, or storage failures. Test your application in an environment as close as possible to production, by simulating or triggering real failures. For example, delete certificates, artificially consume system resources, or delete a storage source. Verify your application's ability to recover from all types of faults, alone and in combination. Check that failures are not propagating or cascading through your system.</p>
<p><strong>Log telemetry data while the application is running in the production environment.</strong>Capture robust telemetry information while the application is running in the production environment or you will not have sufficient information to diagnose the cause of issues while it's actively serving users. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/architecture/best-practices/monitoring" data-linktype="relative-path">Monitoring and Diagnostics</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Implement logging using an asynchronous pattern.</strong>&nbsp;If logging operations are synchronous, they might block your application code. Ensure that your logging operations are implemented as asynchronous operations.</p>
<p><strong>Correlate log data across service boundaries.</strong>&nbsp;In a typical n-tier application, a user request may traverse several service boundaries. For example, a user request typically originates in the web tier and is passed to the business tier and finally persisted in the data tier. In more complex scenarios, a user request may be distributed to many different services and data stores. Ensure that your logging system correlates calls across service boundaries so you can track the request throughout your application.
<p><strong>Deploy multiple instances of services.</strong>&nbsp;If your application depends on a single instance of a service, it creates a single point of failure. Provisioning multiple instances improves both resiliency and scalability. For&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/app-service/app-service-value-prop-what-is/" data-linktype="absolute-path">OpenShift App Service</a>, select an&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/app-service/OpenShift-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/" data-linktype="absolute-path">App Service Plan</a>&nbsp;that offers multiple instances. For OpenShift Cloud Services, configure each of your roles to use&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me/#scaling-and-management" data-linktype="absolute-path">multiple instances</a>. For&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-about/?toc=%2fOpenShift%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json" data-linktype="absolute-path">OpenShift Virtual Machines (VMs)</a>, ensure that your VM architecture includes more than one VM and that each VM is included in an&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-manage-availability/" data-linktype="absolute-path">availability set</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Consider deploying your application across multiple regions.</strong>&nbsp;If your application is deployed to a single region, in the rare event the entire region becomes unavailable, your application will also be unavailable. This may be unacceptable under the terms of your application's SLA. If so, consider deploying your application and its services across multiple regions.</p>
<p><strong>Automate and test deployment and maintenance tasks.</strong>&nbsp;Distributed applications consist of multiple parts that must work together. Deployment should be automated, using tested and proven mechanisms such as scripts. These can update and validate configuration, and automate the deployment process. Use&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/OpenShift-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates" data-linktype="absolute-path">OpenShift Resource Manager templates</a>&nbsp;to provision OpenShift resource. Also use automated techniques to perform application updates. It is vital to test all of these processes fully to ensure that errors do not cause additional downtime. All deployment tools must have suitable security restrictions to protect the deployed application; define and enforce deployment policies carefully and minimize the need for human intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Use staging and production features of the platform.</strong>. For example, OpenShift App Service supports&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/app-service/web-sites-staged-publishing" data-linktype="absolute-path">deployment slots</a>, which you can use to stage a deployment before swapping it to production. OpenShift Service Fabric supports&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-upgrade" data-linktype="absolute-path">rolling upgrades</a>&nbsp;to application services.</p>
<p><strong>Place virtual machines (VMs) in an availability set.</strong>&nbsp;To maximize availability, create multiple instances of each VM role and place these instances in the same availability set. If have multiple VMs that serve different roles, such as different application tiers, create an availability set for each VM role. For example, create an availability set for the web tier and another for the data tier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Provide rich instrumentation for likely failures and failure events</strong>&nbsp;to report the situation to operations staff. For failures that are likely but have not yet occurred, provide sufficient data to enable operations staff to determine the cause, mitigate the situation, and ensure that the system remains available. For failures that have already occurred, the application should return an appropriate error message to the user but attempt to continue running, albeit with reduced functionality. In all cases, the monitoring system should capture comprehensive details to enable operations staff to effect a quick recovery, and if necessary, for designers and developers to modify the system to prevent the situation from arising again.</p>
<p><strong>Monitor system health by implementing checking functions.</strong>&nbsp;The health and performance of an application can degrade over time, without being noticeable until it fails. Implement probes or check functions that are executed regularly from outside the application. These checks can be as simple as measuring response time for the application as a whole, for individual parts of the application, for individual services that the application uses, or for individual components. Check functions can execute processes to ensure they produce valid results, measure latency and check availability, and extract information from the system.</p>
<p><strong>Regularly test all failover and fallback systems.</strong>&nbsp;Changes to systems and operations may affect failover and fallback functions, but the impact may not be detected until the main system fails or becomes overloaded. Test it before it is required to compensate for a live problem at runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Test the monitoring systems.</strong>&nbsp;Automated failover and fallback systems, and manual visualization of system health and performance by using dashboards, all depend on monitoring and instrumentation functioning correctly. If these elements fail, miss critical information, or report inaccurate data, an operator might not realize that the system is unhealthy or failing.</p>
<p><strong>Track the progress of long-running workflows and retry on failure.</strong>&nbsp;Long-running workflows are often composed of multiple steps. Ensure that each step is independent and can be retried to minimize the chance that the entire workflow will need to be rolled back, or that multiple compensating transactions need to be executed. Monitor and manage the progress of long-running workflows by implementing a pattern such as&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/architecture/patterns/scheduler-agent-supervisor" data-linktype="relative-path">Scheduler Agent Supervisor Pattern</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Plan for disaster recovery.</strong>&nbsp;Create an accepted, fully-tested plan for recovery from any type of failure that may affect system availability. Choose a multi-site disaster recovery architecture for any mission-critical applications. Identify a specific owner of the disaster recovery plan, including automation and testing. Ensure the plan is well-documented, and automate the process as much as possible. Establish a backup strategy for all reference and transactional data, and test the restoration of these backups regularly. Train operations staff to execute the plan, and perform regular disaster simulations to validate and improve the plan.</p>

          <h4>Glossary of practices </h4><br/>
<p><strong>Implement application-level protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.</strong>&nbsp;OpenShift services are protected against DDos attacks at the network layer. However, OpenShift cannot protect against application-layer attacks, because it is difficult to distinguish between true user requests from malicious user requests. For more information on how to protect against application-layer DDoS attacks, see the "Protecting against DDoS" section of&nbsp;<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/C/A/3/CA3FC5C0-ECE0-4F87-BF4B-D74064A00846/OpenShiftNetworkSecurity_v3_Feb2015.pdf" data-linktype="external">Microsoft OpenShift Network Security</a>&nbsp;(PDF download).</p>
<p><strong>Implement the principle of least privilege for access to the application's resources.</strong>&nbsp;The default for access to the application's resources should be as restrictive as possible. Grant higher level permissions on an approval basis. Granting overly permissive access to your application's resources by default can result in someone purposely or accidentally deleting resources. OpenShift provides&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles/" data-linktype="absolute-path">role-based access control</a>&nbsp;to manage user privileges, but it's important to verify least privilege permissions for other resources that have their own permissions systems such as SQL Server.</p>

                      <h4>Glossary of practices </h4>
  
            <p><strong>Geo-replicate data in OpenShift Storage</strong>. Data in OpenShift Storage is automatically replicated within in a datacenter. For even higher availability, use Read-access geo-redundant storage (-RAGRS), which replicates your data to a secondary region and provides read-only access to the data in the secondary location. The data is durable even in the case of a complete regional outage or a disaster. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/storage/storage-redundancy" data-linktype="absolute-path">OpenShift Storage replication</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Geo-replicate databases</strong>. OpenShift SQL Database and Cosmos DB both support geo-replication, which enables you to configure secondary database replicas in other regions. Secondary databases are available for querying and for failover in the case of a data center outage or the inability to connect to the primary database. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/sql-database/sql-database-geo-replication-overview" data-linktype="absolute-path">Failover groups and active geo-replication</a>&nbsp;(SQL Database) and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally" data-linktype="absolute-path">How to distribute data globally with OpenShift Cosmos DB</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Use optimistic concurrency and eventual consistency</strong>. Transactions that block access to resources through locking (pessimistic concurrency) can cause poor performance and considerably reduce availability. These problems can become especially acute in distributed systems. In many cases, careful design and techniques such as partitioning can minimize the chances of conflicting updates occurring. Where data is replicated, or is read from a separately updated store, the data will only be eventually consistent. But the advantages usually far outweigh the impact on availability of using transactions to ensure immediate consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Use periodic backup and point-in-time restore</strong>. Regularly and automatically back up data that is not preserved elsewhere, and verify you can reliably restore both the data and the application itself should a failure occur. Ensure that backups meet your Recovery Point Objective (RPO). Data replication is not a backup feature, because human error or malicious operations can corrupt data across all the replicas. The backup process must be secure to protect the data in transit and in storage. Databases or parts of a data store can usually be recovered to a previous point in time by using transaction logs. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/architecture/resiliency/recovery-data-corruption" data-linktype="relative-path">Recover from data corruption or accidental deletion</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Understand the replication methods for your application's data sources.</strong>&nbsp;Your application data will be stored in different data sources and have different availability requirements. Evaluate the replication methods for each type of data storage in OpenShift, including&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/storage/storage-redundancy/" data-linktype="absolute-path">OpenShift Storage Replication</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/sql-database/sql-database-geo-replication-overview/" data-linktype="absolute-path">SQL Database Active Geo-Replication</a>&nbsp;to ensure that your application's data requirements are satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure that no single user account has access to both production and backup data.</strong>&nbsp;Your data backups are compromised if one single user account has permission to write to both production and backup sources. A malicious user could purposely delete all your data, while a regular user could accidentally delete it. Design your application to limit the permissions of each user account so that only the users that require write access have write access and it's only to either production or backup, but not both.</p>
<p><strong>Document your data source fail over and fail back process and test it.</strong>&nbsp;In the case where your data source fails catastrophically, a human operator will have to follow a set of documented instructions to fail over to a new data source. If the documented steps have errors, an operator will not be able to successfully follow them and fail over the resource. Regularly test the instruction steps to verify that an operator following them is able to successfully fail over and fail back the data source.</p>
<p><strong>Validate your data backups.</strong>&nbsp;Regularly verify that your backup data is what you expect by running a script to validate data integrity, schema, and queries. There's no point having a backup if it's not useful to restore your data sources. Log and report any inconsistencies so the backup service can be repaired.</p>
<p><strong>Consider using a storage account type that is geo-redundant.</strong>&nbsp;Data stored in an OpenShift Storage account is always replicated locally. However, there are multiple replication strategies to choose from when a Storage Account is provisioned. Select&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/storage/storage-redundancy/#read-access-geo-redundant-storage" data-linktype="absolute-path">OpenShift Read-Access Geo Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)</a>&nbsp;to protect your application data against the rare case when an entire region becomes unavailable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use data partitioning</strong>. Divide the data across multiple databases and database servers, or design the application to use data storage services that can provide this partitioning transparently (examples include OpenShift SQL Database Elastic Database, and OpenShift Table storage). This approach can help to maximize performance and allow easier scaling. There are different partitioning techniques, such as horizontal, vertical, and functional. You can use a combination of these to achieve maximum benefit from increased query performance, simpler scalability, more flexible management, better availability, and to match the type of store to the data it will hold. Also, consider using different types of data store for different types of data, choosing the types based on how well they are optimized for the specific type of data. This may include using table storage, a document database, or a column-family data store, instead of, or as well as, a relational database. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/architecture/best-practices/data-partitioning" data-linktype="relative-path">Data partitioning guidance</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Design for eventual consistency</strong>. Eventual consistency improves scalability by reducing or removing the time needed to synchronize related data partitioned across multiple stores. The cost is that data is not always consistent when it is read, and some write operations may cause conflicts. Eventual consistency is ideal for situations where the same data is read frequently but written infrequently. For more information, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn589800.aspx" data-linktype="external">Data Consistency Primer</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce chatty interactions between components and services</strong>. Avoid designing interactions in which an application is required to make multiple calls to a service (each of which returns a small amount of data), rather than a single call that can return all of the data. Where possible, combine several related operations into a single request when the call is to a service or component that has noticeable latency. This makes it easier to monitor performance and optimize complex operations. For example, use stored procedures in databases to encapsulate complex logic, and reduce the number of round trips and resource locking.</p>
<p><strong>Use queues to level the load for high velocity data writes</strong>. Surges in demand for a service can overwhelm that service and cause escalating failures. To prevent this, consider implementing the&nbsp;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn589783.aspx" data-linktype="external">Queue-Based Load Leveling Pattern</a>. Use a queue that acts as a buffer between a task and a service that it invokes. This can smooth intermittent heavy loads that may otherwise cause the service to fail or the task to time out.</p>
<p><strong>Minimize the load on the data store</strong>. The data store is commonly a processing bottleneck, a costly resource, and often not easy to scale out. Where possible, remove logic (such as processing XML documents or JSON objects) from the data store, and perform processing within the application. For example, instead of passing XML to the database (other than as an opaque string for storage), serialize or deserialize the XML within the application layer and pass it in a form that is native to the data store. It's typically much easier to scale out the application than the data store, so you should attempt to do as much of the compute-intensive processing as possible within the application.</p>
<p><strong>Minimize the volume of data retrieved</strong>. Retrieve only the data you require by specifying columns and using criteria to select rows. Make use of table value parameters and the appropriate isolation level. Use mechanisms like entity tags to avoid retrieving data unnecessarily.</p>
<p><strong>Aggressively use caching</strong>. Use caching wherever possible to reduce the load on resources and services that generate or deliver data. Caching is typically suited to data that is relatively static, or that requires considerable processing to obtain. Caching should occur at all levels where appropriate in each layer of the application, including data access and user interface generation. For more information, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/architecture/best-practices/caching" data-linktype="relative-path">Caching Guidance</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Handle data growth and retention</strong>. The amount of data stored by an application grows over time. This growth increases storage costs, and increases latency when accessing the data &mdash; which affects application throughput and performance. It may be possible to periodically archive some of the old data that is no longer accessed, or move data that is rarely accessed into long-term storage that is more cost efficient, even if the access latency is higher.</p>
<p><strong>Optimize Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) using an efficient binary format</strong>. DTOs are passed between the layers of an application many times. Minimizing the size reduces the load on resources and the network. However, balance the savings with the overhead of converting the data to the required format in each location where it is used. Adopt a format that has the maximum interoperability to enable easy reuse of a component.</p>
<p><strong>Set cache control</strong>. Design and configure the application to use output caching or fragment caching where possible, to minimize processing load.</p>
<p><strong>Enable client side caching</strong>. Web applications should enable cache settings on the content that can be cached. This is commonly disabled by default. Configure the server to deliver the appropriate cache control headers to enable caching of content on proxy servers and clients.</p>
<p><strong>Use OpenShift blob storage and the OpenShift Content Delivery Network to reduce the load on the application</strong>. Consider storing static or relatively static public content, such as images, resources, scripts, and style sheets, in blob storage. This approach relieves the application of the load caused by dynamically generating this content for each request. Additionally, consider using the Content Delivery Network to cache this content and deliver it to clients. Using the Content Delivery Network can improve performance at the client because the content is delivered from the geographically closest datacenter that contains a Content Delivery Network cache. For more information, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OpenShift/architecture/best-practices/cdn" data-linktype="relative-path">Content Delivery Network Guidance</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Optimize and tune SQL queries and indexes</strong>. Some T-SQL statements or constructs may have an impact on performance that can be reduced by optimizing the code in a stored procedure. For example, avoid converting&nbsp;<strong>datetime</strong>&nbsp;types to a&nbsp;<strong>varchar</strong>&nbsp;before comparing with a&nbsp;<strong>datetime</strong>&nbsp;literal value. Use date/time comparison functions instead. Lack of appropriate indexes can also slow query execution. If you use an object/relational mapping framework, understand how it works and how it may affect performance of the data access layer. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ms176005.aspx" data-linktype="external">Query Tuning</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Consider de-normalizing data</strong>. Data normalization helps to avoid duplication and inconsistency. However, maintaining multiple indexes, checking for referential integrity, performing multiple accesses to small chunks of data, and joining tables to reassemble the data imposes an overhead that can affect performance. Consider if some additional storage volume and duplication is acceptable in order to reduce the load on the data store. Also, consider if the application itself (which is typically easier to scale) can be relied upon to take over tasks such as managing referential integrity in order to reduce the load on the data store.

  <h1 pid="54"><strong style="line-height: 1.45;">What Does DevOps 2.0 Look Like? </h1)<br/> <h2>The Origin of DevOps</strong></h2>
    <p/><h5>by Justin Baker</h5>
<p pid="3">In 2008, Patrick Debois laid the&nbsp;<a href="http://rewrite.ca.com/us/articles/devops/a-short-history-of-devops.html" rel="nofollow">foundations</a>&nbsp;for DevOps at an Agile conference in Toronto. &nbsp;He was trying to come up with a solution for the inherent conflicts between developers and system admins. &nbsp;&nbsp;Both disciplines seemed to be at odds: developers wanted to release software more frequently, but system admins wanted to ensure stability, performance, and scalability. &nbsp;While this conflict isn’t necessarily black and white, it highlighted the need for developers and system admins to no longer consider themselves as mutually exclusive roles, but rather as cross-functional partners.</p>
<p pid="4">A year later, Paul Hammond and John Allspaw gave a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/10-deploys-per-day-dev-and-ops-cooperation-at-flickr" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&nbsp;at the Velocity ‘09 conference that highlighted the necessity for cooperation between Dev and Ops. &nbsp;This inspired Debois to coin the term “DevOps” (#DevOps), which quickly picked up momentum (and a fair share of controversy).</p>
<p pid="5">Now, with the proliferation of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/" rel="nofollow">DevOpsDays</a>&nbsp;meetups and DevOps communities around the world, the movement has accelerated.</p>
<p pid="41"><img alt="DevOps 2.0 Trends LaunchDarkly Feature Flags" class="fr-fin fr-dib" src="https://dzone.com/storage/temp/2112150-devops-keyword.jpg" title="DevOps 2.0 Trends LaunchDarkly Feature Flags" width="807"></p>
<h2>DevOps 1.0</h2>
<p pid="7">We all know that labeling something with version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0… makes our eyes roll. &nbsp;In this case, however, we can frame DevOps 1.0 as the birth and emergence of a nuanced movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;This nuance is in establishing its initial identity: a way to bridge the gap between development and operations with a visionary goal to accelerate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-delivery" rel="nofollow">continuous delivery and deployment</a>.</p>
<p pid="8">Broadly speaking, the DevOps movement centers around the philosophy that building, testing, and releasing software should happen continuously and incrementally. &nbsp;The age of waterfall releases is slowly winding down and most progressive development teams are&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/2014/10/16/devops-continuous-delivery/" rel="nofollow">embracing continuous delivery</a>&nbsp;as the de facto development method.</p>
<p pid="9">In terms of a disciplinary definition, DevOps is at the intersection of development, QA, and operations. &nbsp;It has become an amalgamation of soft and hard skills: trust, cross-functional teams, DVCS, and robust QA/continuous delivery systems.</p>
<p pid="44"><img alt="The DevOps System LaunchDarkly Development Operations QA" class="fr-fin fr-dib" src="https://dzone.com/storage/temp/2112151-devops.jpg" title="The DevOps System LaunchDarkly Development Operations QA" width="807"></p>
<p pid="11">As we see, DevOps has become a systemic term that treats software delivery as an organic and fluid process. &nbsp;Our application is now treated as a living entity, where we harness a suite of services to ensure that our software infrastructure can adapt to change, iterate quickly, and proactively mitigate risk.</p>
<p pid="12">We have now embraced the notion that software does not need to be perfect when it is first launched. &nbsp;We do not need to embrace a monolithic release and hope that our months of planning, design, and operations development have led us on the right path. &nbsp;Hence, the DevOps movement was founded on the notion that the best software is adaptive, not reactive. &nbsp;To make adaptive software, we are now embracing systems that are built for change.</p>
<p pid="13">With consumers now demanding the expedient delivery of near-perfect software and with a global tech boom, how do software companies stay competitive? &nbsp;How do companies leverage DevOps to stay lean, adapt to change, maintain stability, and deliver software faster? &nbsp;This question leads us to emergence of DevOps 2.0: extending the feedback loop benefits of dev and ops to the entire organization: marketing, sales, product, dev, and ops.</p>
<h2>DevOps 2.0</h2>
<p pid="15">DevOps 1.0 has been heavily centered around harmonizing the interplay of development, QA, and operations. &nbsp;The primary goal has been to institutionalize continuous delivery, while also creating more flexible and stable application infrastructure. &nbsp;With DevOps 2.0, we see the emergence of adaptive feature delivery as a critical component for successful software releases.</p>
<p pid="46"><img alt="DevOps 1.0 and DevOps 2.0 LaunchDarkly Feature Toggles Feature Flags" class="fr-fin fr-dib" src="https://dzone.com/storage/temp/2112152-devops2.jpg" title="DevOps 1.0 and DevOps 2.0 LaunchDarkly Feature Toggles Feature Flags" width="808"></p>
<p pid="45">This need for adaptation is both internal and external. &nbsp;Internally, teams must adopt cross-functional methods to ensure that software is:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Iterated with a continuous cadence</li>
 <li>Scaled quickly while maintaining system stability</li>
 <li>Complementary to marketing and sales campaigns</li>
</ul>
<p pid="17">Externally, teams must respond to a customer market that is in a continuous state of flux. &nbsp;Because customer culture shifts so rapidly, customers’ expectations now change from month-to-month instead of year-to-year.</p>
<h3 pid="18"><strong>Team Coordination</strong></h3>
<p pid="19">For organizations, DevOps 2.0 brings the power of DevOps to non-technical team members. &nbsp;While this may sound risky, it actually empowers marketing, design, and business teams to control targeted visibility and testing without consuming engineering resources. &nbsp;Because feature rollout will be decoupled from code deployment, non-technical team members would be able to control the visibility of particular features without compromising the app’s integrity. &nbsp;This is primarily achieved by harnessing a<a href="http://blog.launchdarkly.com/enterprise-requirements-for-managing-feature-flags/" rel="nofollow">&nbsp;feature flag user interface</a>&nbsp;– or a comparable control panel that allows team members to target users via a GUI.</p>
<p pid="48"><img alt="DevOps 2.0 Principles Decouple Feature Rollout from Code Deployment LaunchDarkly Feature Flags Feature Toggles and Risk Mitigation" class="fr-fin fr-dib" src="https://dzone.com/storage/temp/2112154-devops2-cycle.jpg" title="DevOps 2.0 Principles Decouple Feature Rollout from Code Deployment LaunchDarkly Feature Flags Feature Toggles and Risk Mitigation" width="808"></p>
<p pid="21">Therefore, the central challenge for DevOps 2.0 is harnessing the appropriate tools to ensure that software deployments are responsive to consumer demands. &nbsp;In the last few years, a number of DevOps tools have emerged to help facilitate coordination between previously disparate disciplines.</p>
<h3 pid="22"><strong>DevOps Tools</strong></h3>
<p pid="23">DevOps has evolved into a&nbsp;breadth of coordinated development processes. &nbsp;These processes work together to help teams deliver better software, faster. &nbsp;DevOps is not about using one particular tool, it is about using the right combination of tools to accelerate development and mitigate risk. &nbsp;This list captures&nbsp;some of emergent DevOps tools categorized by purpose:</p>

<p pid="24">This is not an endorsement of one tool over another. &nbsp;DevOps is about harnessing a diverse software suite to meet your organization’s evolving needs.</p>
<h3 pid="25"><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p pid="26">A major cornerstone of DevOps 2.0 is the ability to control feature releases independently from your code deployments. &nbsp;Broadly speaking, it is the understanding that features do not need to be waterfall released into the wild, but that they can be controlled in a production context. &nbsp;With DevOps 2.0…</p>
<ul>
 <li><em>Designers</em>&nbsp;can conduct user testing by toggling experimental features on and off for test users</li>
 <li><em>Sales</em>&nbsp;can bundle features into custom plans or perform product demos to individual customers</li>
 <li><em>Marketing</em>&nbsp;can run beta programs to get testimonials and case studies even before a formal launch</li>
 <li><em>Product team</em>&nbsp;can&nbsp;see features before they are release,&nbsp;<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/the-new-way-to-conduct-real-time-user-research" rel="nofollow">get real user feedback</a>, and continuously monitor product development</li>
 <li><em>Developers</em>&nbsp;can&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.launchdarkly.com/feature-flag-driven-development/" rel="nofollow">feature flag</a>&nbsp;code to release it in logical chunks, mitigate risk, and roll back poorly performing features</li>
 <li><em>System admins</em>&nbsp;can&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.launchdarkly.com/feature-flagging-to-mitigate-risk-in-database-migration/" rel="nofollow">perform database migrations</a>&nbsp;with mitigated risk</li>
</ul>
<h3 pid="27"><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>
<p pid="28">Here are some of the&nbsp;<a href="http://launchdarkly.com/featureflags.html" rel="nofollow">benefits</a>&nbsp;of separating feature rollout from code deployment in a DevOps 2.0 world:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Release Code in Logical Chunks
  <ul>
   <li>You can release incomplete features into production and keep them turned off. &nbsp;This allows you to release code in logical chunks, even if some of the features cannot be fully deployed.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Risk Mitigation
  <ul>
   <li>Turn off poorly performing features without redeploying.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>User Targeting
  <ul>
   <li>Manage the visibility of features for particular users.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Percentage Rollouts
  <ul>
   <li>Incrementally release features to your users for&nbsp;<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/the-new-way-to-conduct-real-time-user-research" rel="nofollow">testing and feedback</a>. &nbsp;Assess infrastructure performance.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Kill Switch
  <ul>
   <li>Quickly turn off a poorly performing feature.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Payment Plans
  <ul>
   <li>Control subscriptions plans by bundling feature flags into a plan.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>A/B Testing of Functionality
  <ul>
   <li>Run A/B tests&nbsp;of features to see which features perform better.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Sunseting Features
  <ul>
   <li>Cleanly sunset old, unused features.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Opt In Beta
  <ul>
   <li>Run beta programs on your live application by explicitly including the people you want to see a new feature.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Paygates
  <ul>
   <li>Control subscription plans by bundling features via&nbsp;<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html" rel="nofollow">flags or toggles</a>.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Maintenance Mode
  <ul>
   <li>Put portions (or your entire application) into&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.launchdarkly.com/how-launchdarkly-uses-feature-flags-for-rolling-maintenance-modes/" rel="nofollow">maintenance mode</a>.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Newbie vs. Power User
  <ul>
   <li>Release new feature for power users and maintain the status quo experience for new users.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<p pid="29">In a broader context, DevOps 2.0 is a user-centered approach to development. &nbsp;Instead of releasing software and hoping it works, we can release software with the ability to adapt to consumer demands and expectations. &nbsp;If we launch a feature and no one likes it, then we can instantly roll it back. &nbsp;If we launch a feature to 1% of our user base and they love it, then we can roll it out to the rest.</p>
<h3 pid="30"><strong>Caveats</strong></h3>
<p pid="31">Of course, any time you grant non-technical team members access to any aspect of your application, there will be some inherent risk. &nbsp;Hence, one of the main purposes of DevOps 2.0 is to mitigate that risk through proper checks, permissions, and unencumbered collaboration.</p>
<p pid="32">By regulating access to feature release controls, teams can place the responsibility of targeted feature visibility into the hands of non-technical members without the risk of having to modify the DB or deploy any changes to the codebase.</p>
<p pid="33">This is not to say that you should give non-developers the ability to control feature rollouts and any aspect of the deployment process. &nbsp;It is to say, however, that DevOps 2.0 will be about empowering non-technical team members without compromising the integrity of the application.</p>
<h2>Future of DevOps 2.0: User-Centered Deployments</h2>
<p pid="35">In the coming years, we will likely see the emergence of tools specifically designed to coordinate the skillsets of both developers and non-developers, thereby taking the principles of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-centered-design.html" rel="nofollow">user-centered design</a>&nbsp;and applying them to a state of continuous delivery and release.</p>
<p pid="36">DevOps, therefore, does not merely remain a way to deploy and maintain an application, it becomes a way to deliver software faster and with less risk. &nbsp;With the rise of continuous delivery, we will deploy software in ways that align with increasing&nbsp;<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/in-2016-can-devops-keep-pace-with-consumer-expecta" rel="nofollow">consumer expectations</a>:</p>
<ul>
 <ul>
  <ul>
   <li>Consumers want new features faster: months not years</li>
   <li>Consumers want bugs fixed immediately: minutes not hours</li>
   <li>Consumers want things to load instantly: milliseconds not seconds</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
</ul>
<p pid="51"><img alt="DevOps 2.0 User Centered Deployments Feature flags to separate code deployment from feature rollout LaunchDarkly" class="fr-fin fr-dib" src="https://dzone.com/storage/temp/2112155-devops2-ucd.jpg" title="DevOps 2.0 User Centered Deployments Feature flags to separate code deployment from feature rollout LaunchDarkly" width="808"></p>
<p pid="38">A user-centered deployment, therefore, is a way to frame continuous delivery from the perspective of your product’s end-user. &nbsp;The way we release software becomes nearly as important as the software itself. &nbsp;It is a way to satiate increasing consumer expectations without compromising the integrity of your application. &nbsp;It also ushers in a new era where we harness continuous delivery to make our users’ lives better, not just a way to accelerate the development cycle.</p>

<p>USG&rsquo;s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/cookies/">"cookies" and other technologies</a>&nbsp;such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Ads that are delivered by USG&rsquo;s advertising platform may appear in USG News and in the App Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from USG's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your USG ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit Ad&nbsp;Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.</p>
<p>USG and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with USG more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the USG Online Store. Knowing your country and language &minus; and if you are an educator, your school &minus; helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>If you want to disable cookies and you&rsquo;re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your USG mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp; Security section, and tap on &ldquo;Block Cookies&rdquo; to manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the USG website will not be available once cookies are disabled.</p>
<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. USG may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.</p>
<p>In some of our email messages, we use a &ldquo;click-through URL&rdquo; linked to content on the USG website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.</p>
<p>Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.</p>
<h2 class="typography-section-subhead">Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
<p>At times USG may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with USG to provide products and services, or that help USG market to customers. For example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize USG and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service. If you are approved for service, your account will be governed by USG and your carrier&rsquo;s respective privacy policies. Personal information will only be shared by USG to provide or improve our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>
<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Service Providers</h3>
<p>USG shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever USG operates.</p>
<h3 class="typography-subsection-headline">Others</h3>
<p>It may be necessary &minus; by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence &minus; for USG to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p>We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.</p>
<h2 class="typography-section-subhead">Protection of Personal&nbsp;Information</h2>
<p>USG takes the security of your personal information very seriously. USG online services such as the USG Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). When your personal data is stored by USG, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures. iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.</p>
<p>When you use some USG products, services, or applications or post on an USG forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.</p>
<p>If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family&mdash;including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases&mdash;may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information. [See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/icloud/family-sharing/">About Family Sharing</a>&nbsp;for more information.]</p>
<h2 class="typography-section-subhead">Integrity and Retention of Personal Information</h2>
<p>USG makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<h2 class="typography-section-subhead">Access to Personal Information</h2>
<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account at&nbsp;<a href="https://USGid.USG.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyUSGId.woa/wa/chooseYourCountry">https://USGid.USG.com/</a>. For other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if USG is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.&nbsp;We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made through the regional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/contact/">Privacy Contact Form</a>.</p>
<h2 class="typography-section-subhead">Children &amp; Education</h2>
<p>We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using USG products and services. Children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own USG IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed USG ID account (where available) through their school. For example, a parent must review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/parent-disclosure/">USG ID and Family Sharing Disclosure</a>&nbsp;and agree to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/parent-disclosure/#consent">Consent to USG&rsquo;s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child&rsquo;s Information</a>; and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/">iTunes Store Terms and Conditions</a>, before they can begin the USG ID account creation process for their child. In addition, schools that participate in USG School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed USG IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed USG IDs for students. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/legal/education/USG-school-manager/">Managed USG IDs for Students Disclosure</a>&nbsp;describes how USG handles student information and supplements USG&rsquo;s Privacy Policy. Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/icloud/family-sharing/">Family Sharing</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/education/it/">Managed USG IDs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://support.USG.com/en-us/HT201304">Restrictions</a>&nbsp;for children&rsquo;s accounts.</p>
<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child&rsquo;s USG ID, they may contact us through our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/contact/">Privacy Contact Form</a>.</p>
<p>Or by using the contact information&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/#questions">here</a>.</p>
<h2 class="typography-section-subhead">Location-Based Services</h2>
<p>To provide location-based services on USG products, USG and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your USG computer or device. Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices&rsquo; approximate location. Unless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by USG and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.</p>
<p>Some location-based services offered by USG, such as the &ldquo;Find My iPhone&rdquo; feature, require your personal information for the feature to&nbsp;work.</p>
<h2 class="typography-section-subhead">Third‑Party Sites and Services</h2>
<p>USG websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties &minus; for example, a third‑party iPhone app.</p>
<p>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.</p>
<p>If you purchase a subscription in a third party app or within News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher which we use to provide reports to the developer or publisher that include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.</p>
<h2 class="typography-section-subhead">International Users</h2>
<p>All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. Personal information, relating to USG services, regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area and Switzerland is controlled by USG Distribution International in Ireland, and processed on&nbsp;its behalf by USG Inc. USG uses approved Model Contractual Clauses for the international transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland. USG, as a global company, has a number of legal entities in different jurisdictions which are responsible for the personal information which they collect and which is processed on their behalf by USG Inc. For example, point of sale information in our Retail entities outside the U.S. is controlled by our individual Retail entities in each country. USG, Online Store and iTunes related personal information may also be controlled by legal entities outside the U.S. as reflected in the terms of each service.</p>
<p>USG abides by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apec.org/Groups/Committee-on-Trade-and-Investment/~/media/Files/Groups/ECSG/CBPR/CBPR-PoliciesRulesGuidelines.ashx">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules System</a>. The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies. To learn more about the APEC Certification and Dispute Resolution, please click on the TRUSTe seal.</p>
<h2 class="typography-section-subhead">Our Companywide Commitment to Your&nbsp;Privacy</h2>
<p>To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to USG employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.</p>
<p><a name="questions"></a></p>
<h2 class="typography-section-subhead">Privacy Questions</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about USG&rsquo;s Privacy Policy or data processing or if you would like to make a complaint about a possible breach of local privacy laws, please&nbsp;<a href="https://www.USG.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/contact/">contact us</a>. You can always contact us by phone at the relevant&nbsp;<a href="https://support.USG.com/en-us/HT201232">USG Support</a>&nbsp;number for your&nbsp;country.</p>
<p>When a privacy question or access/download request is received we have a dedicated team which triages the contacts and seeks to address the specific concern or query which you are seeking to raise. Where your issue may be more substantive in nature, more information may be sought from you. All such substantive contacts receive a response. If you are unsatisfied with the reply received, you may refer your complaint to the relevant regulator in your jurisdiction. If you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances.</p>
